I am a master student of Computer Science at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany. Having great interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI), I am a curious and passionate deep learning practitioner in the field of Computer Vision. I am also a huge fan of the *Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) principle* and the *Feynman Technique*.
