A good way to provide more information about skills and qualification listed in the resume is to tell stories using the **STAR** method.

## What is STAR?

- **S**ituation: What was the context of the story?
- **T**ask: What ws your role in the situation?
- **A**ssessment/**A**ction: What did you do?
- **R**esults: What did your action lead to? What was the accomplishment?
  - If possible, always try to include something quantifiable in your success statement
