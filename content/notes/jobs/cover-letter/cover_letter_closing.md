The cover letter closing is where you **reinforce your strongest selling points** as a candidate.

Your cover letter ending should convince the hiring manager to call you in for an interview before another company snaps you up first.

## How to close a cover letter

Your cover letter closing needs to grab the attention of employers and guarantee they remember your application. 

To accomplish this, when closing your cover letter, ensure you include the following three sections:

1. <span style="color:orange">Final body paragraph</span> — add your key selling points here
2. <span style="color:red">Cover letter closing</span> — push for an interview and say you’ll follow up
3. <span style="color: #2eb82e">Sign off</span>— use HR-approved language to achieve the right level of formality

## Tips for writing a strong cover letter ending

### Restate your value as an employee

Emphasize **what you can do for the employer** to explain how you’ll add value to the company if hired.

- State how your skills, expertise, and experience will directly benefit their business.
- By focusing on the needs of the company instead of your own, you’ll end your cover letter by showing the hiring manager you’re serious about the role and a results-driven candidate.

*I’d be honored to show you in an interview how I can bring the same results I had at Frontier Health, and boost employee retention at Monsanto Inc. by 10% in under a year through the implementation of low-cost training courses and employee benefits.*

### Express your passion for the industry and the company

- One of the most desirable traits in an employee is **genuine enthusiasm**.
  - Employers know that passionate workers maintain and improve their performance over time, resulting in longer retention rates and higher productivity.
- Use your cover letter closing paragraph to demonstrate how passionate you are about the work associated with the job

{{< spoiler text="Example" >}} 

*As a devotee of the beauty industry and a loyal customer of Body+ Skincare, I’m excited to use my social media and marketing skills to bolster the company’s reach online. I can’t wait to share my ideas for how best to spread the brand’s message that everyone is beautiful.*

### Quantify your value as an employee

Make it clear that you’d be a strong asset to the company if hired by citing a previous accomplishment (with hard numbers to back it up). 

{{< spoiler text="Example" >}} 

*If hired, I’ll bring the same results-oriented mindset to Power Gym as I brought to UltraFit. I’m looking forward to showing you how I improved member retention by 35% and drove monthly sales of over $2500 in supplements and fitness accessories.*

### Focus on the company’s future

- You should know the values and goals of your target company
  - Knowing the company’s goals allows you to establish a connection with the hiring manager, and shows how you can be a vital part of achieving the company’s mission.
- If you explain in your cover letter closing how your objectives align with the organization’s and how you’ll help them grow, hiring managers will know you’re a dedicated employee and serious about the role.

{{< spoiler text="Example" >}} 

*SmartMeals’ mission statement is that it wants to reinvent how people approach their diet. On your team, I would continue to develop my conscientious approach to customer service and help create the most compelling organic food shopping experience imaginable.*

### Show you’ve done your research on the company 

- Hiring managers value employees who are invested in the company and willing to learn about the job. 
- One of the best ways to show you’re invested is by researching the company and referencing your research at the end of your cover letter.
- Subjects you could choose to research about potential employers
  - mission
  - products
  - culture
- Sometimes simply browsing the company’s website is sufficient to find information to include

{{< spoiler text="Example" >}} 

*After reviewing Lonestar’s 2022 balance sheet, I found the debt to equity ratio to be high in Q2. At my previous company, Skyward, I decreased their debt by 10% in under 2 years through altering inventory and storage costs. I would love to share my techniques in an interview and discuss how I could be an asset to Lonestar’s financial department.*

### Leave a time for following up with the hiring manager

- A quick and easy way to show the hiring manager that you’re motivated to excel at the job is by leaving a time in your cover letter closing for following up with them
- Note: when leaving a time or date for contacting the hiring manager, ensure that you don’t come off as too pushy. 

{{< spoiler text="Example" >}} 

*I’m looking forward to discussing my skills and experience in more detail soon. I’ll be in touch next week to follow up, just to make sure you received my application. Thank you for your time and consideration.*
