## Why Follow Up

A follow-up Email lets you reconnect and request an update in a polite, professional way while also showing you are still interested in the job. In fact, if you approach it correctly, the hiring manager may see you as a stronger candidate after, and that could be enough to tip you over the edge and secure you an offer. 

## What is a Follow-up Email

A follow-up Email is **a brief email asking for more information about your status within the hiring process after you haven’t heard back in a reasonable amount of time.**

- contains a simple request for an update
- You can also use it to do more (*e.g.* reaffirm your interest in the role)
- it’s normal to express your appreciation for being considered (even if the hiring manager has not reached out since meeting you)

## When Should Follow Up

- (Normally) **5 business days** after the end of your job interview if you have not heard anything
- If the employer provided an expected date for feedback after the interview, follow up **one business day** after that date has passed.

## How to Follow Up by Email

### Follow up with whom?

Follow up with **whoever said they’d been in touch after your interview**. If you’re not sure, follow up with **whoever you were emailing to scheduling the interview**.

> **The person who scheduled your interview is a good person to follow up with to check the status of interview feedback.**

### Subject line of the follow-up Email

Simply reply to the latest email thread (that you used to schedule the interview) and leave the previous subject line.

For example, let’s say that this was the previous email subject line:

> Interview on Thursday at 10:00 AM

You should hit “reply” in your email program and then the subject line will look like this:

> Re: Interview on Thursday at 10:00 AM

Continuing with the existing email thread and leaving the subject line as-is will boost your email’s chances of getting opened faster. The recipient will open your follow-up email because it’s clear what the email is about (and it’s clear that you’re not a stranger or someone cold-emailing them).

**If you don’t have a previous email to reply to, then choose one of the following subject lines for your interview follow-up email:**

- Job interview follow-up
- Following up regarding job interview
- Interview status follow-up
- Following up regarding interview results

###  Body of the Follow-Up Email

Tips

- Should be short and to-the-point.
  - Most employers prefer to receive a short and sweet follow-up email after the job interview without any unnecessary info.
- Be clear and direct about why you’re following up. Don’t be timid.
- Should be polite and respectful, no matter how long you’ve been waiting.
- Ensure there are no spelling/grammar/punctuation errors

How to write

- Greet the recipient.
- Explain that you’re following up regarding the job you interviewed for, to ask about the status.
- Be specific when mentioning the job; include the job title, the date you interviewed, or both.
- Reaffirm your interest in the position.
- Ask directly for an update and say you look forward to hearing about the next steps.
- Offer to Share More Information.
- Finish by thanking the reader and signing off with your first and last name.
- Keep your interview follow-up email short and to-the-point without any unnecessary content.
- Run spellcheck, and proofread everything before sending your follow-up email.
- Maintain a positive tone throughout, and do NOT show frustration, even if this is a second or third follow-up after no response.

## Useful Tips

### What Else to Do While Waiting for Interview Feedback

- Keep in mind that delays happen and the hiring process takes time.
- **The best thing for you to do while waiting for a status update is to apply for more jobs and try to get more interviews scheduled.** You shouldn’t stop doing this until you’ve signed a job offer!

### Employer Says They Don’t Have Any Feedback Yet

In some cases, the hiring manager or recruiter will reply to your follow-up email and say they’re still in the middle of the hiring process and don’t have information about the next steps yet.

**You should respond with a brief email to keep the conversation alive and ensure that you stay in touch.**

Template

> Hello [NAME],
>
> Thank you for the information.
>
> When would be an appropriate time for me to check back in?
>
> I’m excited about the opportunity and want to stay in touch, but I know these things take time so I don’t want to follow up too often here.
>
> Any information that you can share about the process would be great. 
>
> Thank you,
>
> [YOUR NAME]

### The Company Hasn’t Responded to Multiple Emails After the Interview

- Make sure you’ve waited one or two days for a response to your most recent email (not counting weekends).
- Send a follow-up to the same person, replying to the same email you already sent and keeping the same email subject line.

Template

> Hi [NAME],
>
> I just wanted to follow up again, make sure you saw my last email, and ask whether you have any status updates regarding the [JOB TITLE] position that I interviewed for on [DATE]. I’m looking forward to hearing back about potential next steps when you have a chance. Thank you so much!
>
> Thank you,
>
> [YOUR NAME]

**Be patient** if you still haven't gotten a response

- There’s a chance that an important person in the hiring process is on vacation, or that the person you’ve been emailing is extremely busy, sick, etc.

  $\rightarrow$ Waiting a minimum of 48-72 hours at this point, and in some cases, a full week is better to wait.

- Try to focus on other tasks in your job search while waiting to ask for an update again.
- Pick the next logical person in the company to email.

## How to Follow up after an Interview if You Have Been Rejected

Be **POSIVITE**! 💪

- Do NOT worry about it and treat it as a learning experience. Improve in next time!
- Do NOT be negative, frustrated, or angry in any way.
- Always reply but be **positive**
  - Respect their decision not to hire you. Also understand you weren't the right person for their organization at that particular time.
  - Demonstrate to them that they have missed out thay you are a professional and mature person
