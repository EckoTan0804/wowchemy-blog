After applying for a new position, you may receive an opportunity to interview. The next step is to accept and confirm with an email response. When an employer responds to your job application with an interview request, it is good practice to get back to them quickly and with enthusiasm.

## What is an interview confirmation email?

An interview confirmation email is **an email you can send to accept an opportunity to interview**.

- allows you to convey your availability and interest in the opportunity
- gives you a chance to ask any questions regarding the interview

## What to include when confirming an interview?

Provide the following information in your email:

- **Subject line.** 
  - In the subject line, specify that you are writing to confirm your interview. 
  
  - You can include the words *interview confirmation* to show the hiring manager know what your message contains.
  
  - Example: 
  
    > **Subject**: Interview Confirmation {Job Title} - {Your Name}
  
- **Purpose**
  - Start the email stating your reasons for writing the email. 
  - You can begin by expressing gratitude for having received the opportunity.
  
- **Additional questions**

- **Contact information.**
  - Remember to include your contact information like phone number, email or other details.
  - They may already have these details, but it is good to include them for ease of communication.

## How to confirm an interview in an email

### 1. Answer promptly

After receiving an interview opportunity, try to respond **quickly** (Ideally on the same day as you get the interview mail).

- This shows hiring managers you value their time and take the opportunity seriously. 
- It may also help you schedule an interview soon, which could give you a competitive advantage.

‼️ One exception: When you receive notice of an interview, hiring managers might mention that they plan to send a confirmation email to you. 

- If that's the case, wait for the email to arrive. 
- If you don't receive a confirmation message within a day or two, follow up with the hiring manager to confirm.

### 2. Draft your message

- Start your email by thanking the hiring manager for their consideration.
- Try to be precise and direct in your email by including only those details which are necessary.
  - If you are interested in the position, mention your availability along with your phone number. 
  - If you are not interested, respond politely with a short explanatory message.

- Try to keep your tone professional and positive.

- Ask What You Should Bring
  - You should always bring several copies of your resume to your interview.
  - Some companies might want other documents—social security card, portfolio of work, etc.—on hand during the interview.


### 3. Close and review your email

- Close the email by thanking your recipient again or by adding an email close, such as sincerely. 
- Sign your name
- Add your contact information to make it easier for the hiring manager to contact you if necessary
- Before sending, proofread your message carefully
