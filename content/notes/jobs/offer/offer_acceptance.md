## TL;DR

Two important steps to accepting a job offer：

1. Carefully evaluate the job offer (terms and conditions)
2. Always officially accept a job offer via a letter or email. 
   - Make sure the writing is error-free. Proofread before sending

## Evaluate the Job Offer 

Review the job offer in detail and consider whether the official offer aligns with your expectations. 

- Are the benefits, training hours, or salary discussed during the [job interview](https://novoresume.com/career-blog/questions-to-ask-an-interviewer) the same as what you’re being offered now? 

Important steps to properly evaluate a job offer

- **Get the job offer in writing.**

  If the employer makes the official offer through a phone call, you should ask them to also send it in written form. This way, you can review all the terms and conditions carefully and negotiate any terms expressed in the offer more effectively. 

- **Ask for time to think the offer through.**

  Instead of making a rushed decision just so that you don’t lose your spot at the company, ask for some time to think the offer through. Most employers will grant you 1 or 2 days to decide, so if you let them know you’re still interested but need some time to think about the terms, they probably won’t mind.

- **Be ready to negotiate.** 

## Write a Job Offer Acceptance Letter or Email

It’s much better to accept the job offer **in writing**.

Steps to write a job offer acceptance email: 

1. **Write a clear and concise subject line.** 

   Your email’s subject line has to be professional and let the employer know exactly what the email is about (e.g. *“Job offer acceptance email - John Doe”*). 

2. **Express gratitude.** 

   Start the email by thanking the employer for trusting you with the opportunity (e.g. *“Thank you for trusting me with the [job title] position in [company X]”*). 

3. **Accept the job offer.** 

   For example: *“I am delighted to officially accept the position of Head of Content at Bookster and be part of your team.”*

4. **State and agree to the employment terms.** 

   - If you’ve already read and agreed to the employment terms as they were presented by the employer, you can simply state that in your email (e.g. *“Let me take this opportunity to formally agree with all the employment terms stated in the official job offer”*).
   - If, however, you’ve negotiated something else and you don’t have that down in writing, now’s the time to officialize it (e.g. *“As discussed, my starting salary is [$X], with [benefits] being part of the offer”*).  

5. **Confirm the starting date.** 

   Then, confirm your starting date to avoid any possible misunderstandings. For example, *“I confirm my starting date is next Monday, April 4th.”*  

6. **Conclude positively.** 

   For example, *“Looking forward to working alongside you!”*

After writing, proofread several times to ensure error-free.
