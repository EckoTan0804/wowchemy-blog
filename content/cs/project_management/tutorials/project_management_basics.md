## What is project management?

Project management is the art of making a plan, then executing on it.

## Project management skills

### Communication

- Team members need clarifications, stakeholders need status updates and sponsors need the results.

### Time management

- Aside from managing the project's schedule, you'll need to keep meetings on track (and manage your own time, too). 

### Problem solving

 

### Organizational awareness

- Get familiar with other projects that might need the same people and resources at the same time you're going to need them. 

### Diplomacy

- Be prepared to negotiate scheduling snafus, conflicting priorities, and personality clashes with grace.

 

## Project management steps

 

### 1. Envision it

*Iterate on your understanding of the problem space, and potential solutions, until you're confident you're on the right track.*

- **Build the business case**
  - Define the problem you're trying to solve, and the value in solving it.

  - Talk to your target customers (internal or external), so you fully understand the problem space.

  - When building a business case for your project, focus on what you want the customer to be able to do.

  - Leave the specifics of how for when you brainstorm solutions with your team.

  - Recommended activities: 

  - - [Problem framing](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing) – Explore a problem  space and its affect on customers. 
    - [Customer   interview](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/customer-interview) – The ultimate empathy-builder. 

- **Form the project team**
  - Gather people with the skills you'll need to solve the problem. 
    - Aim for a  multi-disciplinary team with a variety of backgrounds and  problem-solving styles. ([diverse teams deliver better results](https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-diversity-can-drive-innovation).)

  - Recommended activities: 
    - [Working   agreements](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/working-agreements) – Establish the project team's social contract.
    - [Health Monitor](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/health-monitor/project-teams) – The team's  self-assessment of strength and risk areas.

- **Define "success"**
  - Agree on measurable outcomes to shoot for, and metrics to track your progress toward them.

  - Make sure the project contributes to larger objectives the business is pursuing. 
    - If it doesn't, this might  be the wrong project (or it might be the right project, but at the wrong  time).

  - Recommended activities: 
    - [Goals, signals,   measures](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/goals-signals-measures) – Set goals as a team and agree on how you'll measure  progress. 

- **Brainstorm solutions**
  - Think about specific solutions, how you'd implement them, and how the customer will interact with the final product.

  - Involve your team, and be ambitious at this stage.

  - Recommended activities: 

  - - [Disrupt](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/disruptive-brainstorming) – Generate a long  list of great ideas in a short time.
    - [Mindmapping](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/mind-mapping) – Explore  different facets of a problem, and organize your ideas for solutions.

- **Prototype and test**
  - A prototype could be anything from flowcharts on the back of a cocktail napkin to quick-n'-dirty (but working) code (depends on the project)

  - Put it in front of your target customers and stakeholders for early feedback. --> This is the ideal time to fail and adapt!

  - Recommended activities: 
    - [End-to-end demo](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/end-to-end-demo) – Visualize your  concept so it's easy to get feedback.
    - [Experience   canvas](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/experience-canvas) – Make sure your concept is user-focused, feasible, and  valuable to both the customer and the business.

#### <span style="color: Red">Signs your project is at risk during the envision step</span>

- <span style="color: Red">The project's value is unclear</span>

  Solution

  - Choose a specific customer persona (whether internal or external customer), and turn on your empathy. Imagine why they would want this
  - Map that to the company's larger goals
  - Iterate until you've got customer value with strong ties to business value.
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[5 "whys"](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/5-whys)** – Give your team a deep understanding of the problem and its impact on your customer.
    - **[Customer interview](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/customer-interview)** – Understand your customers' needs and the contexts in which they're using your product or service.
    - **[Experience canvas](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/experience-canvas)** – Make sure your project is customer-focused and makes sense for the business.

- <span style="color: Red">Goals or priorities conflict</span>

  Solution

  - Agree on one (yes, one) objective to serve as your North Star for the project
    - Then sort through the conflicting priorities with that in mind
  - When you encounter trade-offs, prioritize the option that'll get you closer to that North Star objective
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[Goals, signals, measures](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/goals-signals-measures)** – Make sure the project stays focused, and you know what a successful outcome looks like.
    - **[Trade-off sliders](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/trade-offs)** – Create sliding scales to show how important each metric is and agree on what you should prioritize. 

- <span style="color: Red">Nobody knows who is in charge</span>

  Soluiton

  - Reach a shared understanding across the project team, stakeholders, and sponsors as to who is ultimately accountable.
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[Roles and responsibilities](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/roles-and-responsibilities)** – Define each person's role on the project, and what's needed of them so the team can be successful.
    - **[Project kick-off](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/project-kickoff)** – Build a shared understanding of the project's main objective, scope, value, timing, and decision ownership.
    - **[DACI decision-making framework](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/daci)** – Understand who's accountable for specific decisions, and what role the rest of the team will play.

- <span style="color: Red">The project team can't agree on a direction</span>

  Solution

  - Make sure your team truly understands the problem you're solving and it's impact on the customer
  - Don't be afraid to ask management to clarify what's a priority for the business vs. what's not.
  - When seeking guidance, make sure to present them with options you're considering, instead of an open-ended "what should we do?".
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[Problem framing](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)** – Explore the problem space and its impact on customers.
    - **[Demo trust](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/demo-trust)** – Create a space for open discussion and feedback from company leaders so everyone feels confident about the value and direction.

### 2. Plan it

The planning process should be relatively short. While it is recommended an iterative approach to planning, there are a few high-order tasks before moving into project execution mode.

 

- **Nail down the project's scope**
  - Based on feedback from early testing, and keeping your success metrics in mind, prioritize what to include in the project.

  - Be clear about the trade-offs you're making.

  - Recommended activities: 
    - [Trade-off   sliders](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/trade-offs) – Create sliding scales to show how important each metric is  and agree on what you should prioritize.
    - [Journey mapping](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/customer-journey-mapping) – Understand  the existing journey so you can design a better experience.




- **Understand and manage dependencies**
  - Map out what the project depends on (work, resources, or assets from outside the core project team, etc.)

  - Noting who will own each piece of work and when they're available to do it. 
    - Even if you can't resolve  bottlenecks at this stage, you need to identify them and factor them  into the project planning process.

  - Recommended activities: 
    - [Roles and   responsibilities](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/roles-and-responsibilities) – Define each person's role on the project,  and what's needed of them.




- **Build a roadmap and backlog**
  - With scope agreed upon and dependencies understood
    - Break the project plan down  into discrete pieces of work
    - Estimate the time and  effort required for each

  - Project when you'll hit major milestones and set a target completion date

  - Collect all pieces of work into a backlog you can use to plan in short, iterative cycles.

  - Recommended activities: 
    - [Roadmap planning](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/roadmaps/advanced-roadmaps) – This exercise  comes from the software world, but can be adapted to suit any project. 




- **Anticipate and mitigate risks**
  - Think through ways the project might fail, and dive into prevention mode

  - Also identify chances for mind-blowing success that you haven't yet considered

  - Recommended activities: 

  - - [Pre-mortem](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/pre-mortem) – Imagine what  could go wrong, and make plans to prevent them. 




- **Make a communications plan**
  - Establish a cadence for team meetings and updates to stakeholders, and share it around.

  - Schedule any recurring meetings, and put reminders on your calendar to update the project's plan and dashboard (or internal homepage) regularly.

  - Recommended activities: 
    - [Stand-ups](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/standups) – A daily  opportunity for your team to share the status of work in progress and  discuss blockers.
    - [Project poster](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/project-poster) – An easy way to  share your goals, status, and schedule.  If updated regularly, the poster  serves as your status report (but far less painful). 

#### <span style="color: Red">Signs your project is at risk during the planning step</span>

- <span style="color: Red">You are stuck in planning mode</span>

  Solution

  - Shake off that "analysis paralysis", and get going!
  - If you're using [an agile approach](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management) (and you really should), remind the project team you'll have chances to demonstrate progress and course-correct as you go.
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[Project kick-off](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/project-kickoff)** – Build a shared understanding of the project's main objective, scope, value, timing, and decision ownership.
    - **[Pre-mortem](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/pre-mortem)** – Visualize risks and opportunities for the project, then figure out how to navigate yourself away from (or toward) them.

- <span style="color: Red">Others don't understand what your project is about</span>

  Solution

  - Call upon those communication skills and share small, frequent updates that are easy to digest 
  - Make sure you're sharing the right information in the right level of detail with the right people
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[Elevator pitch](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/elevator-pitch)** – Create a simple explanation of your project and the value it delivers to your customers.
    - **[Project poster](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/project-poster)** – Shape and share your ideas, articulate what success looks like, and build a shared understanding with stakeholders.

- <span style="color: Red">Your project team is missing critical skills</span>

  - Re-shape your concept so you can move forward with the resources you have
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[Trade-off sliders](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/trade-offs) –** The basic trade-off sliders exercise clarifies which aspects of a project are negotiable (and which aren't), but you can give it a twist. If you can't do "X", what other aspects of the project can flex to help you navigate the skill gap?


### 3. Execute it

*Work in 1- to 2-week iterations, with a demo for stakeholders and a team retrospective at the end of each cycle.* 

 

- **Work iteratively**
  - [Agile methodologies](https://www.atlassian.com/agile) are useful for any project

  - Start each cycle with "just enough" planning, then knock out the work

  - Hold a short retrospective at the end of each iteration.
    - Share what went well (and  what didn't) so the next iteration can be even better.

  - Recommended activities: 
    - [Sprint planning](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/agile/sprint-planning-atlassian) – Plan the next  1-2 weeks' work based on what's highest priority. 
    - [Retrospectives](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective) – Provide a safe  space for the team to reflect on and share what works well (and what  doesn't!) so you can improve.




- **Track your progress**
  - This includes 
    - which pieces of work are  complete 
    - how much of the budget  remains
    - whether you're on track to  meet your target delivery date.

  - Use something digital like Google Docs, [Trello](http://www.trello.com/), or [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) so everyone can see your status easily.

  - If you start burning through budget or time faster than projected, raise that with your sponsor and team right away so you can course-correct before things get out of hand.

  - Recommended activities: 
    - [Set up a Trello board](http://www.trello.com/) – Organize and  prioritize your project in a fun, flexible way.
    - [Set up a Jira   dashboard ](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/jira-core/jira-core-dashboard-project-status-glance)– The information your team and stakeholders need, in a custom  layout. 




- **Test and incorporate feedback**
  - At the end of each iteration cycle, update your end-to-end demo to reflect the work completed, and show it to stakeholders (and customers, ideally).

  - Capture their feedback so you can take it into account when planning the next iteration.

  - Recommended activities: 
    - [End-to-end demo](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/end-to-end-demo) –  Visualize your  concept so it's easy to get feedback.
    - [Sparring](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/sparring) – Let others  challenge your own ideas and inspire new ones.

#### <span style="color: Red">Signs your project is at risk during the planning step</span>

- <span style="color: Red">You are stepping on each other's toes</span>

  Solution

  - Remove and prevent bottlenecks in your process. 
  - Clarify each person's role or area of responsibility on the project so you're not blocking each other or doubling up on tasks.
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[Stand-ups](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/standups)** – Start the day with updates on who's-working-on-what, what got done yesterday, and which tasks each person intends to tackle next.
    - **[Roles and responsibilities](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/roles-and-responsibilities)** – Understand everyone's role on the team, and learn what teammates need from each other in order to succeed.

- <span style="color: Red">Feels like you're just spinning your wheels</span>

  Solution

  - Shine a light on everything your team is accomplishing. 
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[End-to-end demo](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/end-to-end-demo)** – Celebrate the incremental wins by iterating on a demo. As it evolves from diagrams to prototype to an MVP, your team's progress will feel more tangible.
    - **[Stand-ups](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/standups)** – Create a feeling of momentum by highlighting what got done yesterday (and/or expose the hard truth that nothing is getting to the "done" pile).

- <span style="color: Red">Score creep!</span>

  Solution

  - It depends. 
    - If your schedule and/or budget are flexible, you might opt to expand the project's scope. 
    - Otherwise, you'll need to deflect additional ideas or make trade-offs to accommodate them. Just don't skimp on the quality of work you deliver!
  - Remember: for most projects, you can keep making improvements after you deliver the initial "minimum viable product" (MVP).
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[Trade-off sliders](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/trade-offs)** – Decide which aspects of the project you'll prioritize, and think though the trade-offs you'll make in their defense when new ideas are introduced.
    - **[DACI decision-making framework](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/daci)** – Agree on who makes the call and who contributes recommendations – either for individual decisions about scope, or for the project as a whole.

- <span style="color: Red">Communication has broken down</span>

  Solution

  - If people are purposefully withholding information because they're playing politics, you may need to involve a neutral party (such as HR) to facilitate.
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[Stand-ups](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/standups)** – Practice communicating and build trust: share quick updates on tasks and raise blocking issues.
    - **[Sparring](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/sparring)** – If team members aren't pushing each other creatively, use this technique from the design world to get honest, structured peer feedback.
    - **[Health Monitor](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/health-monitor/project-teams)** – Provide a safe space for the team to discuss how you're working together (strengths, weaknesses, warts n' all).
    - **[Working agreement](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/working-agreements)** – Codify the team's values: the practices, results, and conduct you expect from one another. 

- <span style="color: Red">Estimates were way off-target</span>

  Solution

  - Recalibrate your projected timeline based on the information you have about the actual effort needed to reach your milestones.
  - Be open about this so stakeholders have a chance to adjust their expectations and any down-stream plans.
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[Retrospective](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective)** – Set aside time in each retrospective to compare that iteration's estimates with the actual effort needed so you can continually recalibrate.
    - **[5 "whys"](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/5-whys)** – Start with one estimate-gone-wrong to analyze and ask why it was so off – then keep asking "why" until you've uncovered the root cause.


### 4. Deliver it

- **Deliver your "minimum viable product" (MVP)**
  - Make sure the customers accept the project as complete
  - Depending on how smooth or rocky the journey was, you may want to get their acceptance in writing.




- **Close out the budget**

 

- **Do a project retrospective**
  - Put questions up for discussion with your project team
    - What went well? 
    - What went horribly,  horribly wrong?

  - Be sure to capture the lessons learned and share them with your peers so they can benefit. 

  - Don't forget to chat about how you might improve on what you just delivered.

  - Recommended activities:
    - [Retrospective](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective) – Reflect on and  discuss what works well (and what doesn't!) so you can improve. Mistakes  are ok if you learn from them. 

#### <span style="color: Red">Signs your project is at risk during the planning step</span>

- <span style="color: Red">The project isn't accepted as "Done"</span>

  Solution

  - Talk to your sponsor (or client, or team, or whomever is unhappy) and figure out where the discrepancy lays
  - Your goal for this conversation is to agree on a definition of "done" – something you should put in writing so it's easy for everyone to refer back to later
    - From there, draw up a list of tasks that'll close the gap between here and "done", and set your team on it.
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[Demo trust](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/demo-trust)** – Use this as a forum for discussing "done" and next steps with your management team.


### 5. Improve it

Take a moment to consider these questions: 

- Have you achieved your definition of "success" for the project?
- Are there ideas that were de-scoped from the MVP?

#### <span style="color: Red">Signs your project is at risk during the planning step</span>

- <span style="color: Red">Your MVP isn't being used, and you don't know why</span>

  Solution

  - Do some qualitative research
  - Talk to your target customers to find out what's preventing them from putting your project to use
  - (If appropriate) Set up a user test (either live, or using an online service) so you have a chance to observe their behavior as they interact with what you've delivered.
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[Customer interview](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/customer-interview)** – Go straight to the source and ask what the hang-up is.
    - **[Empathy mapping](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/empathy-mapping)** – Pair your quantitative data with your knowledge of the customer to understand how they think and feel about your project.

- <span style="color: Red">Incremental cahnges aren't moing the needle</span>

  Solution

  - Go bold. This might mean a major pivot, or overhauling your project entirely.
  - Don't get discouraged, though. Making one major change on your way to success puts your batting average at a respectable .500
  - **Recommended activities:**
    - **[5 "whys"](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/5-whys)** – Use this analysis technique to uncover the root of the problem so you know what future changes need to address.
    - **[Disrupt](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/disruptive-brainstorming)** – De-calcify your neuro pathways and generate fresh ideas.
