Suppose we have trained a few classifiers, each one achieving about 80% accuracy.

A very simple way to create an even better classifier is to aggregate the predictions of each classifier and predict the class that gets the **most** votes.

This majority-vote classifier is called a **hard voting classifier**

> Surprisingly, this voting classifier often achieves a higher accuracy than the best classifier in the ensemble. In fact, even if each classifier is a weak learner (meaning it does only slightly better than random guessing), the ensemble can still be a strong learner (achieving high accuracy), provided there are a sufficient number of weak learners and they are sufficiently diverse. (Reason behind: the law of large numbers)

 

**Ensemble methods work best when the predictors are as independent from one another as possible.** 

- One way to get diverse classifiers is to **train them using very different algorithms.** This     increases the chance that they will make very different types of errors, improving the ensembleâ€™s accuracy.
- Another approach is to use the **same** training algorithm for every predictor, but to train them on different random subsets of the training set. (See [Bagging and Pasting]({{< relref "bagging-and-pasting.md" >}}))
