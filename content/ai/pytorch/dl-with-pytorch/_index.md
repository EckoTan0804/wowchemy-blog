## Code

- [Github repo](https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code)

- Almost all of our example notebooks contain the following boilerplate in the first cell (some lines may be missing in early chapters)

  ```python
  %matplotlib inline
  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
  import numpy as np
  import torch
  import torch.nn as nn
  import torch.nn.functional as F 
  import torch.optim as optim
  
  torch.set_printoptions(edgeitems=2) 
  torch.manual_seed(123)
  ```
