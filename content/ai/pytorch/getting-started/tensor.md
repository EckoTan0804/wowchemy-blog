```python
import torch
```

- similar to Numpy's `ndarray`
- can also be used on a GPU to accelerate computing

## Operations

- similar to operations of Numpy's `ndarray`

  ```python
  x = torch.zeros(5, 3, dtype=torch.float)
  y = torch.randn_like(x, dtype=torch.float)
  
  x + y
  ```

- size: `size()`

  ```python
  x.size()
  ```

- in-place operation: post-fixed with an `_`

   ```python
  y.add_(x)
   ```

- Numpy-like indexing

  ```python
  x[:, 1]
  ```

- resize/reshape: `view()`

  ```python
  a = torch.ones(4, 4)
  b = a.view(-1, 8) # the size -1 is inferred from other dimensions
  # b should have size (2, 8)
  ```

- For one element tensor, use `.item` to get the value as a python number:

  ```python
  x = torch.rand(1)
  x.itemp
  ```



## PyTorch $\leftrightarrow$ Numpy

### Torch Tensor $\rightarrow$ Numpy Array

Use `numpy()`

```python
a = torch.ones(5) # torch tensor
b = a.numpy() # convert to numpy array
```

{{% callout warning %}} 

If both pytorch tensor and numpy array are on CPU, change one of them will change the another.

{{% /callout %}}

### Torch Tensor $\leftarrow$ Numpy Array

Use `from_numpy()`

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.ones(5) # numpy array
b = torch.from_numpy(a) # convert to torch tensor
```

{{% callout warning %}} 

Change the np array will change the torch tensor automatically

{{% /callout %}}

{{% callout note %}} 

Note: All the Tensors on the CPU **except a CharTensor** support converting to NumPy and back.

{{% /callout %}}

## CUDA Tensors

- Tensors can be moved onto any device using the `.to` method.
- Use `torch.device` objects to move tensors in and out of GPU

```python
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    y = torch.ones_like(x, device=device) # Create a tensor on GPU directly
    x = x.to(device) # Move a tensor to GPU use .to()
    z = x + y

    z.to("cpu", torch.double)
```
