**TL;DR**

- `collection.namedtuple` is a memory-efficient shortcut to defining an immutable class in Python manually.
- Namedtuples can help clean up your code by enforcing an easier to understand structure on your data, which also improves readability.
- Namedtuples provide a few useful helper methods that all start with an `_` underscore‚Äîbut are part of the public interface.

## What is `namedtuple`?

Python‚Äôs tuple is a simple immutable data structure for grouping arbitrary objects. It has two shortcomings:

- The data you store in it can only be pulled out by accessing it through integer indexes. You can‚Äôt give names to individual properties stored in a tuple. This can impact code readability.
- It‚Äôs hard to ensure that two tuples have the same number of fields and the same properties stored on them. 

`namedtuple` aims to solve these two problems. [namedtuple](http://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) is a **factory function** for making a tuple class. With that class we can create tuples that are callable by name also.

- `namedtuple` is *immutable* just like regular tuple

  - Once you store data in top-level attribute on a namedtuple, you can‚Äôt modify it by updating the attribute.
  - All attributes on a namedtuple object follow the **‚Äúwrite once, read many‚Äù principle**.

- Each object stored in them can be accessed through a unique (human-readable) string identifier. 

  ‚Üí This frees you from having to remember integer indexes, or resorting to workarounds like defining integer constants as mnemonics for your indexes. üëè

## How `namedtuple` works?

Let's take a look at an example:

```python
from collections import namedtuple

User = namedtuple("User", ["name", "id", "gender"])
user = User("Ecko", 1, "male")
```

```python
>>> user
User(name='Ecko', id=1, gender='male')
```

- `"User"` as the first argument to the `namedtuple `factory function is referred to as the ‚Äútypename‚Äù in the Python docs. It‚Äôs the name of the new class that‚Äôs being created by calling the `namedtuple `function, which needs to be *explicitly* specified.

The code above is equivalent to

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, id, gender):
        self.name = name
        self.id = id
        self.gender = gender

user = User("Ecko", 1, "male")
```

## Why `namedtuple`?

Namedtuple objects are implemented as regular Python classes internally. <span style="color:  ForestGreen">When it comes to memory usage, they are also ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than regular classes and just as memory efficient as regular tuples. üëç</span>

A good way to view them is to think that ***namedtuples are a memory-efficient shortcut to defining an immutable class in Python manually***.

## Operations

### Unpacking

Tuple unpacking and the `*`-operator for function argument unpacking also work as expected:

```python
name, id, gender = user
print(f"name: {name}, id: {id}, gender: {gender}")
```

```txt
name: Ecko, id: 1, gender: male
```

```python
print(*user)
```

```txt
Ecko 1 male
```

### Accessing Values

Values can be accessed either by identifier or by index.

By identifier:

```python
>>> user.name
Ecko
```

By index:

```python
>>> user[0]
Ecko
```

### Built-in Helper Functions

`namedtuple` has some useful helper methods. 

- Their names all start with an underscore character `_`
  - With `namedtuples` the underscore naming convention has a different meaning though: These helper methods and properties are part of namedtuple‚Äôs public interface. 
  - The helpers were named that way to avoid naming collisions with user-defined tuple fields.

#### `_asdict`

Returns the contents of a `namedtuple `as a dictionary

```python
>>> user._asdict()
OrderedDict([('name', 'Ecko'), ('id', 1), ('gender', 'male')])
```

This is great for avoiding typos in the field names when generating JSON-output, for example:

```python
>>> import json
>>> json.dumps(user._asdict())
'{"name": "Ecko", "id": 1, "gender": "male"}'
```



We can convert a dictionary into a `namedtuple` with `**` operator

```python
>>> user_dict = {"name": "Ben", "id": 2, "gender": "male"}
>>> User(**user_dict)
User(name='Ben', id=2, gender='male')
```

#### `_replace()`

Creates a (shallow) copy of a tuple and allows you to selectively replace some of its fields.

```python
user._replace(id=2)
```

```txt
User(name='Ecko', id=2, gender='male')
```

#### `_make()`

Classmethod can be used to create new instances of a namedtuple from a sequence or iterable

```python
User._make(["Ilona", 3, "female"])
```

```txt
User(name='Ilona', id=3, gender='female')
```

## When to Use `namedtuple`?

- If you're going to create a bunch of instances of a class and NOT change the attributes after you set them in `__init__`, you can consider to use `namedtuple`.
  - Example: Definition of classes in [`torchvision.datasets.cityscapes`](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/_modules/torchvision/datasets/cityscapes.html)
- Namedtuples can be an easy way to clean up your code and to make it more readable by enforcing a better structure for your data. You should use `namedtuple` **anywhere you think object notation will make your code more pythonic and more easily readable**
- But try NOT to use namedtuples for their own sake if they don‚Äôt help you write ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù and more maintainable code.
